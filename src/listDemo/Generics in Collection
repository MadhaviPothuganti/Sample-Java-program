1. Java new generic collection allows you to have only one type of object in collection.
Now it is type safe  so type-casting is not required at run time
    Non-generic arraylist
    ArrayList al = new ArrayList();
 
2. Generic example of creating Java
    ArrayList<string> al = new ArrayList<string>();
    
 In generic collection, we specify the type in angular braces. Now ArrayList is forced to have only specified type of objects in it. If you try to add another type of object, it gives compile time error.
