======>What is List and ArrayList<=========
List=> List is an Interface
ArrayList=> ArrayList is a class and implements List
Java ArrayList class uses a dynamic array for storing /sorting the values
Java ArrayList class can contain duplicate elements
Java Array List class maintains the insertion order
ArrayList allows random access because array works at the index basis
In ArrayList class, Manipulation is slow because lot of shifting needs to be occured if any element is removed from the ArrayList

List/ArrayList comes from Java.util
java.lang.Object
     java.util.AbstractCollection<E>
           java.util.AbstractList<E>
                 java.util.ArrayList<E>
