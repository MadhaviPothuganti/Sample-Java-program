1. An interface can extend another interface in the same way that a class can extend another class.
The "extends" keyword is used to extend an interface, and the child interface inherits the methods of the parent interface.

2. What is Interface?
An interface is a reference type in Java. It is similar to class. It is a collection of abstract methods.
 A class implements an interface, thereby inheriting the abstract methods of the interface. Along with abstract methods,
 an interface may also contain constants, default methods, static methods, and nested types.
