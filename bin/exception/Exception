=====Waht is Exception=====
1. in plain English, Exception is abnormal condition
2. In java also Exception is abnormal scenario which will stop the execution of current program
3. In technical words Exception is a class

==== What is Exception handling====
 1. Exception handling is a way to handle runtime/compile time errors such as
 IOException,ArthematicException and ..etc.
 2. Main reason of exception handling is to maintain the normal flow of the application.
 
 
===Types of Exception===

1. Check Exception:- Checked Exceptions are checked at compile time
2. Unchecked Exception - Unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile-time rather they are checked at runtime
3. Error - Error is irrecoverable
Ex: OutOfMemoryError, VirtualMachineError, AssertionError ..etc

====How to handle exception====
Try-Catch block : Java try block is used to enclose the code that might throw an exception.It must be use within the method.
Java try block must be followed by either catch or finally block.

Try{
//code that may throw exception
}catch(Exception_class_name ref)
{
}

java.lang.Object
   java.lang.Throwable
        java.lang.Exception
             java.lang.RuntimeException
                    java.lang.ArithmeticException
                    
   Finally{
   }
   this block of code is executed irrespective of the exception or not
   This is mandatory to use when working with file handling and database connection to close  once use of files and database
