What is Set:
1. Set in Interface in java which  extends Collection interface.
2. Set Does not allow duplicates values
3. Set is unorderd collection
4. Can't access the data using index


===Hash Set====
1. HashSet stores the elements by using a mechanism called hashinh.
It means we cannot access using index.

2. Hash set contains unique elements only.

===LinkedhashSet=======
It is similer to HashSet but it maintains insertion order.

====TreeSet=====
